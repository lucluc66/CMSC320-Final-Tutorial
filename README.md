# CMSC320-Final-Tutorial

This is a tutorial that will walk users through the entire data science pipeline: data curation, parsing, and management; exploratory data analysis; hypothesis testing and machine learning to provide analysis; and then the curation of a message or messages covering insights learned during the tutorial.

In this tutorial, I will focus on the classification of the NBA players in the 2019 - 2020 Season. I will discuss about how to build a contending team in NBA based on the analysis done.
